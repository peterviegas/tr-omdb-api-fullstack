## About
This was a task from Tech Returners to make a full-stack application in a group of 4 people. The task was open ended - We were told to use a public api and build a frontend and backend for it, we chose [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

## Prerequisites

```
git clone https://github.com/glend1/tr-omdb-api-fullstack/
```

```
npm run custom-install
