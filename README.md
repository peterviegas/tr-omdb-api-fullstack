## About
This was a task from Tech Returners to make a full-stack application in a group of 4 people. The task was open ended - We were told to use a public api and build a frontend and backend for it, we chose [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

## Prerequisites
register for a key at [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/)

## Getting Started
Open a terminal and navigate to a desired folder to clone the respository to and use 
```
git clone https://github.com/glend1/tr-omdb-api-fullstack/
```

## Installing
Make sure you have a new version of node installed on your computer then run

```
npm run custom-install
```

you must also populate `.env.local` in `server/` with the following key(s)
```
